                                  Hi Everyone! My name is Vinitha, I am from India. I was graduated with the masters degree in Business administration from India. I started my career working for hsbc bank as a loan officer in the retail Assets processing team. Then soon after my marriage I moved to united States with my husband who is working as an IT consultant for USDA(Nitc) data center. I live in Overland Park, KS since 2011. I have a financial background and coding was entirely new to me. I developed interest towards writing web content when I started to do write some food blogs. I started working with wordpress(CMS). Then slowly I started learning web technologies like html and css. I didn’t get my work permit until 2015. So I started to work for an Indian software company in remote which is located in my home town where I was a part in developing some of their Ui portions for their clients.
                                  Slowly then I started with the basics of javascript  and learnt Javascript frameworks like Reactjs, Angularjs and mobile frameworks like Ionic and React Native. 
                                  </p>

                                 I started my first Job in united states in 2018 with computer Impressions a startup company located in Overland Park, Kansas ,where I worked there in different projects that helped to gain skills in various technologies. My last job was with Sprint as a software consultant. I am a self-taught developer, I followed tutorials took some courses in udemy . 
                                 I have 2 kids. My hobbies are trying out some new recipes as I have always been fond of cooking, travelling, and reading. I am a positive person, quick learner willing to learn and work with new technologies and develop my career as a full stack developer.
